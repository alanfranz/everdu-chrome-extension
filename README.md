Everdu: chrome extension
=======================

This chrome extension is intented to help you with the content you want to add to your evernote to not having it duplicated.

It has to work modes. Default is, **check on demand**, that means, the extensi√≥n will query your evernote only when you click on the extension's icon. But you can configure the extension to check every url. Obiously, this mode has a larger network overhead.

To **change the configuration**, just right click on the extension's icon and go to configuration and click on the checkbox that appears there. That's all.
